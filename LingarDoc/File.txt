God's Willing : 

Explanations about File object  - see it with the package and run it : .

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html

I've tried to study it from the doc, and the truth it's pretty good. 
after I'll finish it, I will pass on another tutorial for check if I missed something. 

But actually the description there almost didn't get. 


Here in the package there are many classes for working with the File.

Q- this sentence is repeating a lot - 
Where it is required to distinguish an I/O exception from the case that 0L is returned, or where several attributes of the same file are required at the same time, then the Files.readAttributes method may be used.

Maybe need to learn it.
